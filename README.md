# AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp: Introduction to Vibe Coding (workshop)

This workshop constitutes Module 1 of the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp, hosted by DataTalks.Club and taught by Alexey Grigorev.  The workshop takes a very simple use case (create code for the classic "snake game") and walks learners through the process of creating the game using ChatGPT and Claude Code, troubleshooting and modifying code using tools including Cursor and GitHub CoPilot, and finally deploying using Lovable.
